# Find sum and average of List in Python

# Input: [4, 5, 1, 2, 9, 7, 10, 8]
# Output:
# sum =  46
# average =  5.75

from operator import add


# x = [4, 5, 1, 2, 9, 7, 10, 8]
# sum = 0
# avg = 0

# for loop

# for i in x:
#     sum = sum + i
# avg = sum/len(x)
# print(sum)
# print(avg)

# built in method
# sum = sum(x)
# avg = sum/len(x)
# print(sum)
